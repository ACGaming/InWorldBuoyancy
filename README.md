# In-World Buoyancy

*Think before you swim!*

* Items inside the player's inventory become buoyant and drop when swimming
* Fluid containers such as buckets empty themselves and refill with water
* Items transform into others, f.i. books become soggy and turn back into paper
* Fluid sources can only be removed with respective fluid containers (experimental feature)

All listed aspects are configurable and combinable.

Best used with [Hardcore Buoyance](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hardcore-buoyance).
